    "You continue following signs for \"Hot Springs\" and eventually come across an [observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory). The Elf within turns out to be a researcher studying cosmic expansion using the giant telescope here.\n",
    "\n",
    "He doesn't know anything about the missing machine parts; he's only visiting for this research project. However, he confirms that the hot springs are the next-closest area likely to have people; he'll even take you straight there once he's done with today's observation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you can help him with the analysis to speed things up?\n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher has collected a bunch of data and compiled the data into a single giant **image** (your puzzle input). The image includes **empty space** (`.`) and galaxies (`#`). For example:\n",

    "The researcher is trying to figure out the sum of the lengths of the **shortest path between every pair of galaxies**. However, there's a catch: the universe expanded in the time it took the light from those galaxies to reach the observatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to something involving gravitational effects, **only some space expands**. In fact, the result is that **any rows or columns that contain no galaxies** should all actually be twice as big.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, three columns and two rows contain no galaxies:\n",
    "\n",

For each pair, find any shortest path between the two galaxies using only steps that move up, down, left, or right exactly one `.` or `#` at a time. (The shortest path between two galaxies is allowed to pass through another galaxy.)\n",

    "....##...7...\n",
    "8....9.......\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This path has length **`9`** because it takes a minimum of **nine steps** to get from galaxy `5` to galaxy `9` (the eight locations marked `#` plus the step onto galaxy `9` itself). Here are some other example shortest path lengths:\n",
